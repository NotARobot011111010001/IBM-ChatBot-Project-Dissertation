%TODO: DELETE TEXT WITHIN SQUARE BRACKETS
[The text within the square brackets must be deleted along with the square brackets when finalising your chapters. 

This is only a guidance template. Depending on the nature of your project, the structure of your dissertation is open to discussion. Please check with your supervisor if you are not sure. 

Arial, Normal, 11pt with 1.2 or 1.5 line spacing should be used in the main body. The text in this part has 1.5 line spacing. 

Figures must be correctly numbered with captions and paragraph text should not be wrapped around figures - same rules apply to tables. An example of figures can be found below.
